                                         VISITOR DESIGN PATTERN
Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.

For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add different type of items (Elements). When we click on checkout
button, it calculates the total amount to be paid. Now we can have the calculation logic in item classes or we can move
out this logic to another class using visitor pattern. Letâ€™s implement this in our example of visitor pattern.
