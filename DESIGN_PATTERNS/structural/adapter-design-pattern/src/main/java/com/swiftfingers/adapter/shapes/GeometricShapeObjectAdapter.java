remember that Shape is what we have with us) and references the adaptee â€” GeometricShape
(Geometric Shape is like a third-party API we need to consume) in this case. We implement all of
the required methods of the target (Shape) and do the necessary conversion to fulfill our
requirement.
Shape interface is what we have with us (This is the Target interface)
GeometricShape is what we want to plug into (This is the Adaptee)
