 * stored prototypes.
 * Here we create the access control objects on all levels at once, and
 * then provide a copy of the object to the user whenever required. In this case, data fetching from the external resources
 * happens only once. Next time, the access control object is created by copying the existing one.
 * The access control object is not created from scratch every time the request is sent; this approach will
 * certainly reduce object creation time.
