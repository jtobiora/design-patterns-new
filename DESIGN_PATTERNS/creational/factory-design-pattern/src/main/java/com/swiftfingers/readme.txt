                                          FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an
object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to
create the instance of the class.

It is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to
specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call
(new operator). This pattern models an interface for creating an object which at creation time can let its
subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
